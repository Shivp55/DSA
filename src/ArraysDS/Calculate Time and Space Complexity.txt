How to calculate the complexity (Rules + shortcut)

Time Complexity shortcuts:
=> 1 loop over n -> O(n)
=> 2 Nested loops over n -> O(n^2)
=> Sorting -> O(n log n)
=> Binary Search -> O(log n)
=> Loop + Binary Search inside -> O(n log n)
=> Hash Maps Operations average O(1) each -> often leads to O(n)

Space Complexity Shortcuts:
If you create any array/maps of size n -> O(n)
If you only store constants (few ints) -> O(1)
Recursion Depth -> Call Stack space (Often O(n) or O(log n)

=> Space complexity usually counts for extra space, not the input array
