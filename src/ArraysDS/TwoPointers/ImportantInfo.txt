2 Pointers pattern

Two pointers means:
You use 2 indices instead of one
and move them in a controlled way to solve the problem efficiently

Instead of:
=> Nested Loops -> O(n^2)

You use:
=> Two pointers -> O(n)

When should you use the 2 pointers?
- Sorted array is given
- Find pair with given sum
- Remove duplicates
- Reverse an array
- Partition an array
- Palindrome Checking
- Move zeros / rearrange elements
- Compare elements from both the ends

If you see :
"Find two elements"
"Pair whose sum equals"
"Remove duplicates in a sorted array"
=> In all these cases, use two pointers

Types of Two pointer Patterns
Opposite direction(Start and end)
Same direction (Slow and fast)

Basic Syntax: (Pair sum)
int l = 0, r= n-1;
while(l<r){
    long s= (long) a[l]+a[r-1];
    if(s== target) break;
    if(s<target) l++;
    else r--;
}
