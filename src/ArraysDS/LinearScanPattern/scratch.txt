Linear Scan Pattern

What does the pattern mean
You go through the array once(left to right or right to left) and keep a few variables that represent the best answer so far.

Typical things to track:
=> Max/min
=> Count
=> Sum
=> Best Profit
=> Best Difference
=> Last Seen Index - Sometimes with a variable, sometimes with a Hashmap

How can we Identify this pattern:
- Maximum / minimum
- Count how many
- Best Profit
- find first/last
- Single pass or in on traversal
- return a number not a subarray list
- no need to reorder / no need for sub arrays

Strong signal :
If the answer can be updated using only:
-> The current element
->  and a few variables
Then it's linear scan

 When multiple Patterns are possible:
 Sometimes you could use sorting or Hashmap, but linear scan is better when:
 - > You want O(1) extra space
 -> You don't need frequency tables
 -> You don't need to remember how many past states
 -> Sorting would increase the time to O(n log n) bcoz you must preserve order.
