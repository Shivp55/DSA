Kadane's Algorithm  (Maximum Sub araay )
=> This pattern is for questions like:
- Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray
- Best time to take a continuous segment
- Largest profit/score over a run
- Return the max sub array sum(Sometimes also return indices)

Core Idea:
At every index, you decide,
=> Do I extend the previous subarray?
=> Or start a new sub array from here?

So we keep two things:
-> currSum = max( arr[i], currSum + arr[i] )
-> bestSum = max(bestSum, currSum)

How to identify this pattern in a Question:
"contiguous subarray"
"maximum sum"
"largest streak"
"best streak"
"continuous"
And the array has negatves+ptves, Kadane is the almost always the intended approach

Basic Syntax:
long curr =0, best = Long.MIN_VALUE;
for(int x:a){
    curr=Math.max(x, curr+x);
    best=Math.max(best, curr);
}
